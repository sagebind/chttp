## Key features

- Full support for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
- Configurable request timeouts.
- Fully asynchronous core, with asynchronous and incremental reading and writing of request and response bodies.
- Offers an ergonomic synchronous API as well as an asynchronous API (with support for [async/await] coming soon).
- Optional automatic redirect following.
- Sessions and cookie persistence.
- Request cancellation on drop.
- Tweakable redirect policy.
- Network socket configuration.
- Uses the [http] crate as an interface for requests and responses.

## Why cHTTP and not X?

cHTTP provides an easy-to-use, flexible, and idiomatic Rust API that makes sending HTTP requests a breeze. The goal of cHTTP is to make the easy way _also_ provide excellent performance and correctness for common use cases.

cHTTP uses [libcurl] under the hood to handle the HTTP protocol and networking. Using curl as an engine for an HTTP client is a great choice for a few reasons:

- It is a stable, actively developed, and very popular library.
- It is well-supported on a diverse list of platforms.
- The HTTP protocol has a lot of unexpected gotchas across different servers, and curl has been around the block long enough to handle many of them.
- It is well optimized and offers the ability to implement asynchronous requests.

Safe Rust bindings to libcurl are provided by the [curl](https://crates.io/crates/curl) crate, which you can use yourself if you want to use curl directly. cHTTP delivers a lot of value on top of vanilla curl, by offering a simpler, more idiomatic API and doing the hard work of turning the powerful [multi interface] into a futures-based API.

## Installation

Install via Cargo by adding to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
chttp = "0.4"
```

The current release series is `0.4`. Pre-releases of the `0.5` series are also available, which offers first-class support for [async/await] in addition to the traditional synchronous API. Version `0.5` requires Rust 1.36 or newer.

### Supported Rust versions

The current release is only guaranteed to work with the latest stable Rust compiler. When cHTTP reaches version `1.0`, a more conservative policy will be adopted.

### Feature flags

cHTTP is designed to be as "pay-as-you-need" as possible using Cargo feature
flags and optional dependencies. Unstable features are also initially
released behind feature flags until they are stabilized. You can add the
feature names below to your `Cargo.toml` file to enable them:

```toml
[dependencies.chttp]
version = "*"
features = ["async-api"]
```

Below is a list of all available feature flags and their meanings.

- `cookies`: Enable persistent HTTP cookie support. Enabled by default.
- `http2`: Enable HTTP/2 support in libcurl via libnghttp2. Enabled by default.
- `json`: Additional serialization and deserialization of JSON bodies via [serde]. Disabled by default.
- `psl`: Enable use of the Public Suffix List to filter out potentially malicious cross-domain cookies. Disabled by default.
- `static-curl`: Use a bundled libcurl version and statically link to it. Enabled by default.
- `async-api`: Enable the async futures-based API. This allows you to take full advantage of cHTTP's asynchronous core. Currently behind a feature flag until the futures API stabilizes. This an unstable feature whose interface may change between patch releases.
- `middleware-api`: Enable the new middleware API. Unstable until the API is finalized. This an unstable feature whose interface may change between patch releases.

## [Documentation]

Please check out the [documentation] for details on what cHTTP can do and how to use it.

To get you started, here is a really simple example that spits out the response body from https://example.org:

```rust
// Send a GET request and wait for the response.
let mut response = chttp::get("https://example.org")?
// Read the response body into a string and print it to standard output.
let body = response.body_mut().text()?;
println!("{}", body);
```
