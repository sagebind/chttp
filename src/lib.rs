//! The practical HTTP client that is fun to use.
//!
//! ## Sending requests
//!
//! Sending requests is as easy as calling a single function. Let's make a
//! simple GET request to an example website:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use chttp::prelude::*;
//!
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), chttp::Error> {
//! let mut response = chttp::get("https://example.org")?;
//! println!("{}", response.text()?);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! By default, sending a request will wait for the response, up until the
//! response headers are received. The returned response struct includes the
//! response body as an open stream implementing [`Read`](std::io::Read).
//!
//! Sending a POST request is also easy, and takes an additional argument for
//! the request body:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), chttp::Error> {
//! let response = chttp::post("https://example.org", "make me a salad")?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! cHTTP provides several other simple functions for common HTTP request types:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), chttp::Error> {
//! chttp::put("https://example.org", "have a salad")?;
//! chttp::head("https://example.org")?;
//! chttp::delete("https://example.org")?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Custom requests
//!
//! cHTTP is not limited to canned HTTP verbs; you can customize requests by
//! creating your own `Request` object and then `send`ing that.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use chttp::prelude::*;
//!
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), chttp::Error> {
//! let response = Request::post("https://example.org")
//!     .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
//!     .body(r#"{
//!         "speed": "fast",
//!         "cool_name": true
//!     }"#)?
//!     .send()?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Request configuration
//!
//! There are a number of options involved in request execution that can be
//! configured for a request, such as timeouts, proxies, and other connection
//! and protocol configuration. These can be customized by using extension
//! methods provided by the [`RequestBuilderExt`](prelude::RequestBuilderExt)
//! trait:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use chttp::prelude::*;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), chttp::Error> {
//! let response = Request::get("https://example.org")
//!     .timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))
//!     .body(())?
//!     .send()?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Configuration related to sending requests is stored inside the request
//! struct using [`http::Extensions`].
//!
//! ## Custom clients
//!
//! The free-standing functions for sending request delegate to a shared client
//! instance that is lazily instantiated with the default options. You can also
//! create custom client instances of your own, which allows you to set default
//! options for all requests and group related connections together. Each client
//! has its own connection pool and event loop, so separating certain requests
//! into separate clients can ensure that they are isolated from each other.
//!
//! See the documentation for [`Client`] and [`ClientBuilder`] for more details
//! on creating custom clients.
//!
//! ## Asynchronous API and execution
//!
//! Requests are always executed asynchronously under the hood. This allows a
//! single client to execute a large number of requests concurrently with
//! minimal overhead.
//!
//! If you are writing an asynchronous application, you can additionally benefit
//! from the async nature of the client by using the asynchronous methods
//! available to prevent blocking threads in your code. All request methods have
//! an asynchronous variant that ends with `_async` in the name. Here is our
//! first example rewritten to use async/await syntax (nightly only):
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #![cfg_attr(feature = "nightly", feature(async_await))]
//! # use chttp::prelude::*;
//! #
//! # #[cfg(feature = "nightly")]
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), chttp::Error> {
//! # futures::executor::block_on(async {
//! let mut response = chttp::get_async("https://example.org").await?;
//! println!("{}", response.text_async().await?);
//! # Ok(())
//! # })
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Logging
//!
//! cHTTP logs quite a bit of useful information at various levels using the
//! [log] crate.
//!
//! If you set the log level to `Trace` for the `chttp::wire` target, cHTTP will
//! also log all incoming and outgoing data while in flight. This may come in
//! handy if you are debugging code and need to see the exact data being sent to
//! the server and being received.
//!
